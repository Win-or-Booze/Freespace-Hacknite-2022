<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Freespace was created by us to help every student grasp concepts, solve problems, and apply learning, having fun along the way. It is easy to use and user friendly along with many useful features that are required in a traditional classroom.
</p>
<h2>How to Run the Code</h2>
<p>
Please open the file named "home.html" to view our project

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3> Colours </h3>
<p> Our board has 5 basic colours that the user can choose from- black, red, yellow, green and blue. We have also included a colour palette so that the users can choose the shade of their choice. The default color is black and the default tool is pencil</p>

<h3>Line Width</h3>
<p> Our board also gives users an option to choose the line width for using Pencil, Eraser and drawing lines. This width can range from 1 to 10. The default value for it is 5. We have implemented it using a range slider which is easy to use. </p>

<h3>Size of Shapes</h3>
<p> Our board has an option to choose the size of the shape that is radius for the circle and side lengths for square and triangle.
  We have implemented this also using a range slider.
</p>

<h3>Clear, Save and Print</h3>
<p> Clear is used to reset the board.
  Save is used to save the created canvas on the user's system.
  Print is used to print the content of the canvas.
  </p>
  
<h3>Tools for Drawing</h3>
<p> Our board provides users an option to choose from several tools that include Pencil, Eraser, Line and also to draw shapes like Circle, Square and Triangle. 
</p>

<h3>Fill and Dark Theme</h3>
<p> We have also provided some additional features like Fill shape and Dark theme. When the fill shape is enabled, the user can draw shapes that are filled with color.
  Similarly, there is also provision for Dark theme which can be used based on user's personal preference and requirements.

<h2>Challenges Faced/ Bugs</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge was to get started on learning how to use Canvas and Javascript because both of us had no idea about the same and we were new to development</p>
<p>Some of the challenges face by us during the hackathon were:-</p>
<ul>
<li> The major problem that we faced was that our board was drawing a circle immediately after the pencil was lifted even if some other tool was selected. This problem/bug helped us to understand how Event Listeners work in depth. Thanks to Sathvik and Rachit Bhaiya for the same. We also faced some problems in the functions and Animations that we made in Javascript for both home and board page </li>
<li> Another problem was that we were not able to implement the buttons because we had assigned classes to them and since we were using getElementsByClassName, it returns an array. So it was giving an error. Later we went through the Stack overflow page ( mentioned in comments ) and then rectified it by indexing
  </li>
  <li>
    A rather small but important problem that we successfully solved that the shapes were getting drawn when we were changing the size of the shapes using the range slider which was solved by a simple if condition.
  </li>
  <br>
  <p>As a result of these problems, we gained a lot of experience in the field of Development and learned new skills like Canvas, Javascript and ofcourse debugging through Google. Now, as we finish this ReadME file, we are learning how to use version controlm systems like GitHub
</ul>
<h2>Future Scope</h2>
<p>FREESPACE can be used by colleges and schools to simplify the concepts so that it is easy for students to grasp them. But ofcourse it will be a good substitute to the current options only if it has more features. Given the interesting field of Web Development, we intend to add more features like Undo, Redo, Several Pages in the coming time and update the same.
